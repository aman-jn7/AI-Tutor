        - Are free to access or clearly labeled if paid
        - Include tutorials, beginner courses, videos, or step-by-step guides
        - Are likely to be valid and not broken

        ðŸš« Avoid:
        - Broken links, duplicate sources, or irrelevant pages
        - Overly technical or paywalled content unless clearly noted

        Make sure the list is diverse (e.g., not all from YouTube) and helpful to someone new to the topic.
